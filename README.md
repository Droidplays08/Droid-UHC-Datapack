# Droid UHC Datapack
Welcome to Droid UHC Datapack!

This is a bundle of datapack, along with a resourcepack that makes UHC a game for you and your friends a possibility!

Installing: Make sure to unzip the bundle of datapacks, and add them to your world individually. Since there is world generation datapacks, please add the datapack before creating the world. The datapacks are server side, so client do not need to install anything to play.

For resourcepack, there is no need to unzip, you can use the pack directly. If you are hosting a server, you can also include the resourcepack as a server required resourcepack, that way, players who join the server can join without anything installed

The datapack is still currently in Beta, so bugs can occur. Bug fixes and more features coming soon!

Recipe: There is currently no way to see custom recipe in the game. A ui datapack is planned to resolve this. You can see the recipe in the gallery(coming soon)
